# Hard Coding Problems

Hello World,<br>
This repository contains coding problems and solutions that I personally found challenging and time-consuming. These problems focus on programming logic, problem-solving, and interview-style questions—not limited to data structures and algorithms (DSA), but also including logic puzzles and computational thinking. While most examples are currently in JavaScript, other languages may be used in the future. I’ve also uploaded test cases for some problems in a **`tests`** directory, so you can try them out yourself—note that not all problems have accompanying test cases. Difficulty is subjective, so what I found hard may not be the same for you. I may also post DSA problems from LeetCode over time.

## To run the tests, use the following command in the terminal:

> npx jest ./tests/file_Name.test.js

## Disclaimer

I do not own the coding problems or all of the test cases in this repository—they are sourced from various platforms. This collection is for my personal portfolio and for others who may want to practice. Sources will be credited below and in the code comments when applicable.

1. The problems **`calculator.js`** and **`expenditure-analysis.js`**, along with their test cases, are from the public repository [*100xdevs-cohort-2*](https://github.com/100xdevs-cohort-2/assignments/tree/master/01-js) by Harkirat Singh—a well-known software developer, teacher, and YouTuber. I’m solving these assignments as part of the *100xDevs Cohort 0→1*, which I’ve enrolled in.
