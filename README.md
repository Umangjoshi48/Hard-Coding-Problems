#Hard Coding Problems

Hello everyone,
This repository contains coding problems and solutions that I personally found challenging and time-consuming. These problems focus on programming logic, problem-solving, and interview-style questionsâ€”not limited to data structures and algorithms (DSA), but also including logic puzzles and computational thinking. While most examples are currently in JavaScript, other languages may be used in the future. Difficulty is subjective, so what I found hard may not be the same for you. I may also post DSA problems from LeetCode over time.
